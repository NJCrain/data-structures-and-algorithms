## Array Reverse


### Challenge
Write a function that takes an array as an argument and returns an array that is the reverse of the original.

### Approach and Efficiency
The approach used for this challenge was using nested for loops to start from the end of the array and move one item to it's reveresed position each iteration. I'm not sure how to calculate efficiency based on Big O yet.

## Array Shift


### Challenge
Write a function that takes an array and a value as arguments. It should return an array with the new value at the middle index

### Approach and Efficiency
The approach for this challenge was to take all the values in the original array before it's middle and add them to a new array that had a length 1 greater than the original, then insert the new value at the middle index, followed by taking the rest of the values in the original array and adding them to the new array at an index 1 higher than they were in the original. This approach could probably be more efficient, however with only limited knowledge of arrays in Java, this was the only workable idea I wound up with.

## Array Binary Search


### Challenge
Write a function that takes a sorted array and a value as arguments. Utilize a binary search to find the given value and return the index where it is located, or return -1 if it is not in the array.

### Approach and Efficiency
The approach for this challenge was to use a set of conditional checks to determine if the new "middle" index needs to be moved to the left or right or the current location, however the whiteboarded solution missed on handling certain issues. The biggest issues were ensuring that the while loop does eventually exit in the case of not finding the given value, and not adjusting what our right bound is in the instance where we move to the left but then need to move off to the right after. The efficiency of the final solution is O(log n) time at worst, and O(1) space.

## Singly Linked List
A LinkedList class and Node class. The LinkedList keeps track of what node is its head value, and each node contains its own value and a pointer to the node after it in the list.

### Challenge
* Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
* Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
  * This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to head when the linked list is instantiated.
  * Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  * Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
  * Define a method called print which takes in no arguments and outputs all of the current Node values in the Linked List.


### Approach & Efficiency
The approach for the insert method was to reassign the head property to a new Node that is constructed with the passed in value. This makes it a 0(1) time and space function. The includes and print methods both iterate over Nodes while not looking at a null node (the last node in the list). Both of these functions are O(n) time and O(1) space.

### API

#### Insert
takes in an integer value to assign to a new node and inserts it at the head of the linked list

#### Includes
Searches the linked list to see if any node contains the provided value and will return true if so, otherwise returns false.

#### Print
Will print out the list as a comma separated list contained between \< and \> 

## Linked List Insertions


### Challenge
* Add an append challenge to your LinkedList class that takes a value and adds it at the end of the Linked List.
* Add an insertBefore function to your LinkedList class that takes in a value and newValue, and inserts a new Node before the Node that contains the given value.
* Add an insertAfter function to your LinkedList class that takes in a value and newValue, and inserts a new Node after the Node that contains the given value.

### Approach and Efficiency
The approach for all these methods involves iterating over the Nodes in the Linked List until reaching the given position where the new Node needs to be inserted. The new Node is then created and inserted into the list by updating other Nodes next value where necessary. All three of these functions take O(n) time and O(1) space.
